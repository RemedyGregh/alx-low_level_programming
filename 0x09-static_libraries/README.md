. Compiled all the *.c files in my working directory into object files ending with a *.o extension and created an archive or a static library as you may call itto contain this object files. So that the code routines(i.e Functions,Variables,Classes etc) or symbols as some may call it, in them can be called when needed in the process of a building a program, if you ever need any of these symbols, remember to link the library with the program using it during compilation process to produce an executable file, i.e "gcc std=gnu89 main.c -L. -lmy -o quote", where main.c is the program using the library and -L is pointing the compiler to the library in the current directory and -lmy is the name of the library without the lib prefix and the .a suffix and quote is the executable file.

. Created a script that creates a static library for all the *.c files in my current directory, the name of this library is liball which is all.
